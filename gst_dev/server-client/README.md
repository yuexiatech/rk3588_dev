**Server side**:

*   The server program would be responsible for receiving incoming streams from clients, storing them, and making them available for playback.
*   The server would have a pipeline that uses `appsrc` and `appsink` elements to receive data from clients and send it to the storage component.
*   The storage component would use `filesink` and `filesrc` elements to save and retrieve data from disk.
*   The server would also have a pipeline for handling playback requests from clients. This pipeline would use `filesrc`, decoding, encoding, and muxing elements to read data from disk, transcode it into the desired format, and send it to clients.
*   The server would support multiple communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, and RTMP, for receiving data from clients and sending data to them.

**Client side**:

*   The client program would be responsible for capturing audio and video data, encoding it, and sending it to the server.
*   The client would have a pipeline that uses `v4l2src` or other source elements to capture audio and video data from the local system.
*   The captured data would be encoded using encoding elements such as `x264enc` or `vp8enc`, and then sent to the server using `appsrc` and `appsink` elements.
*   The client would support multiple communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, and RTMP, for sending data to the server and receiving data from it.
*   The client could also have a playback component that uses `appsrc`, decoding, and sink elements to receive data from the server and play it back locally.

These are just high-level outlines of the server and client sides of the application. Each side would involve more detailed design and implementation work. Is there anything else you would like to know?
