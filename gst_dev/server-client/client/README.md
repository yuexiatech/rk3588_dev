**Client side:**

*   `main.c`: Contains the main function and initializes the GStreamer library, creates the pipeline, and starts the main loop.
*   `client.c`: Contains functions for setting up the pipeline, handling messages from the server, and sending data to the server.
    *   The pipeline would use `v4l2src` or other source elements to capture audio and video data from the local system.
    *   The captured data would be encoded using encoding elements such as `x264enc` or `vp8enc`.
    *   The encoded data would be sent to the server using `appsrc` and `appsink` elements.
    *   The client would support multiple communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, and RTMP, for sending data to the server and receiving data from it.
*   `playback.c`: Contains functions for setting up the playback pipeline and handling playback of received data.
    *   The playback pipeline would use `appsrc`, decoding, and sink elements to receive data from the server and play it back locally.
*   `protocol.c`: Contains functions for handling communication with the server using different protocols.
    *   The client would support multiple communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, and RTMP, for sending data to the server and receiving data from it.

**Further Description**

This pseudo code shows how the different components of the client side of the application interact with each other. The `main.c` file initializes GStreamer and sets up the main loop. The `client.c` file sets up the pipeline for capturing and sending data to the server. The `playback.c` file handles playback requests from the server. The `protocol.c` file sets up communication with the server using different protocols.
