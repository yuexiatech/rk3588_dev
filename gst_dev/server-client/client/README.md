**Client side outline**:
1.  The client would have a main pipeline that receives data from the server using one of the supported communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, or RTMP.
    
2.  For streaming, the client would use the appropriate protocol-specific source elements to receive data from the server.
    
3.  For video-on-demand, the client would use the `playbin` element to play back stored files received from the server.
    
4.  The client would have a command-line interface using standard C libraries or third-party libraries. This interface would allow users to control the application by passing command-line arguments when starting it.

**File structure**:

*   `main.c`: This file would contain the `main` function, which would parse the command-line arguments and initialize the different components of the application.
    
*   `pipeline.c` and `pipeline.h`: These files would contain the code for creating and managing the main GStreamer pipeline. This would include functions for creating and linking the different elements, handling events, and controlling the pipeline state.
    
*   `protocols/`: This directory would contain files for implementing support for different communication protocols. Each protocol would have its own pair of `.c` and `.h` files, which would contain functions for creating and configuring the appropriate GStreamer elements.
    
*   `playback.c` and `playback.h`: These files would contain the code for implementing video playback. This would include functions for creating and configuring the `playbin` element, as well as managing playback controls such as play, pause, and seek.
    
*   `cli.c` and `cli.h`: These files would contain the code for implementing the command-line interface of the application. This would include functions for parsing command-line arguments and displaying help information.
