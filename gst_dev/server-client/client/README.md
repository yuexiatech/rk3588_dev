**Client side outline**:

*   The client program would have a main function that initializes the GStreamer library, creates a new pipeline object, and sets up the command-line interface.
*   The pipeline would consist of several components, including a client component for communication with the server using one of the supported protocols (RTP, RTSP, RTMP), a decoding component for decoding received audio and video data, and a player component for handling audio and video playback on the client device.
*   The client component would establish a connection with the server and receive audio and video data.
*   The decoding component would select appropriate decoder elements for the H.264/H.265 codecs.
*   The player component would handle audio and video playback on the client device.
*   The command-line interface would allow users to start and stop playback, as well as adjust various settings such as the communication protocol, video resolution, and volume. It would also provide feedback on the status of the client and its components.

**File structure**:

*   `main.c`: Contains the main function that initializes the GStreamer library, creates a new pipeline object, and sets up the command-line interface.
*   `client.c`: Contains code for the client component of the pipeline, including functions for communication with the server using one of the supported protocols.
*   `decoder.c`: Contains code for the decoding component of the pipeline, including functions for decoding received audio and video data.
*   `player.c`: Contains code for the player component of the pipeline, including functions for handling audio and video playback on the client device.
*   `pipeline.c`: Contains code for creating and managing the GStreamer pipeline object.
*   `cli.c`: Contains code for implementing the command-line interface, including functions for parsing user input, executing commands, and providing feedback on the status of the client and its components.

**Further Description**

This pseudo code shows how the different components of the client side of the application interact with each other. The `main.c` file initializes GStreamer and sets up the main loop. The `client.c` file sets up the pipeline for capturing and sending data to the server. The `playback.c` file handles playback requests from the server. The `protocol.c` file sets up communication with the server using different protocols.
