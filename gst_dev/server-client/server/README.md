**Server side outline**:

1.  The server would have a main pipeline that handles the communication between an encoder and a decoder. This pipeline would use `appsrc` and `appsink` elements to facilitate the transfer of audio and video data between the encoder and decoder boards.
    
2.  The main pipeline would also include elements for supporting multiple communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, and RTMP. These elements would be used to send data using these protocols.
    
3.  The server would also have a storage component that uses `filesink` element to save the encoded data to a file for later playback.
    
4.  The main pipeline would also include elements for implementing video conversion and generation at multiple bitrates. It would use encoding elements to encode the raw video data at different bitrates, `videorate` element to change the framerate of the video, and `videoscale` element to change its resolution.
    
5.  The server would have a network bandwidth detection and bitrate selection component that uses QoS events to monitor the network conditions and adjust the bitrate of the encoded video accordingly.
    
6.  The server would have a command-line interface using standard C libraries or third-party libraries. This interface would allow users to control the application by passing command-line arguments when starting it.
    
7.  The main pipeline would also include elements for supporting 4K resolution and H.264/H.265 encoding through elements such as `x264enc` and `x265enc`.
    
8.  The server would have a video-on-demand service component that supports multiple users using `playbin` element in combination with a server application. The server application would handle incoming requests from clients, manage resources, and create new instances of `playbin` element as needed.

*   `main.c`: This file would contain the `main` function, which would parse the command-line arguments and initialize the different components of the application.
    
*   `pipeline.c` and `pipeline.h`: These files would contain the code for creating and managing the main GStreamer pipeline. This would include functions for creating and linking the different elements, handling events, and controlling the pipeline state.
    
*   `protocols/`: This directory would contain files for implementing support for different communication protocols. Each protocol would have its own pair of `.c` and `.h` files, which would contain functions for creating and configuring the appropriate GStreamer elements.
    
*   `storage.c` and `storage.h`: These files would contain the code for implementing the storage component of the application. This would include functions for creating and configuring the `filesink` element, as well as managing the storage of encoded data.
    
*   `conversion.c` and `conversion.h`: These files would contain the code for implementing video conversion and generation at multiple bitrates. This would include functions for creating and configuring encoding elements, as well as managing video conversion parameters such as bitrate, framerate, and resolution.
    
*   `bandwidth.c` and `bandwidth.h`: These files would contain the code for implementing network bandwidth detection and bitrate selection. This would include functions for handling QoS events, monitoring network conditions, and adjusting the bitrate of encoded video.
    
*   `cli.c` and `cli.h`: These files would contain the code for implementing the command-line interface of the application. This would include functions for parsing command-line arguments and displaying help information.
    
*   `vod/`: This directory would contain files for implementing the video-on-demand service component of the application. This would include functions for handling incoming requests from clients, managing resources, and creating new instances of `playbin` element.
    

This is just one possible way to organize the code. The key is to keep each module focused on a specific functionality, with well-defined interfaces between them. This will help to achieve high cohesion within each module, while minimizing coupling between them.
