**Server side outline**:

*   The server program would have a main function that initializes the GStreamer library, creates a new pipeline object, and sets up the command-line interface.
*   The pipeline would consist of several components, including a server component for communication with multiple clients using supported protocols (RTP, RTSP, RTMP), an encoding component for encoding input audio and video data using H.264/H.265 codecs and converting the video to multiple bitrates, and a content manager component for handling client requests for on-demand content.
*   The server component would accept incoming connections from clients and manage the distribution of audio and video data to each client.
*   The encoding component would allow the server application to dynamically adjust the bitrate of the video streams sent to each client based on their network conditions and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.
*   The content manager component would manage stored content and serve it to clients upon request.
*   The command-line interface would allow users to start and stop the server, as well as adjust various settings such as the communication protocol, video resolution, and bitrate. It would also provide feedback on the status of the server and its components.

**Possible file structure**:

*   `main.c`: Contains the main function that initializes the GStreamer library, creates a new pipeline object, and sets up the command-line interface.
*   `server.c`: Contains code for the server component of the pipeline, including functions for communication with multiple clients using supported protocols.
*   `encoder.c`: Contains code for the encoding component of the pipeline, including functions for encoding input audio and video data using H.264/H.265 codecs and converting the video to multiple bitrates.
*   `content_manager.c`: Contains code for the content manager component of the pipeline, including functions for managing stored content and serving it to clients upon request.
*   `pipeline.c`: Contains code for creating and managing the GStreamer pipeline object.
*   `cli.c`: Contains code for implementing the command-line interface, including functions for parsing user input, executing commands, and providing feedback on the status of the server and its components.

**Further Description**

* This pseudo code shows how the different `.c` files interact with each other to receive, store, and playback data. The `main.c` file sets up the GStreamer pipeline and starts the main loop. The `network.c` file contains code for receiving data from clients and sending it to the storage component, as well as sending data to clients. The `storage.c` file contains code for saving and retrieving data from disk. The `playback.c` file contains code for reading data from disk, transcoding it into the desired format, and sending it to clients. Finally, the `request_handler.c` file contains code for handling client requests, such as starting and stopping streams, seeking within streams, and adjusting playback parameters.
