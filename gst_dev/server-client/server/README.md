**Server side outline**:

*   The server program would have a main function that sets up the GStreamer pipeline and starts the main loop.
*   The pipeline would consist of several components, including a network component for receiving data from clients, a storage component for saving data to disk, and a playback component for sending data to clients.
*   The network component would use `appsrc` and `appsink` elements to receive data from clients and send it to the storage component.
*   The storage component would use `filesink` and `filesrc` elements to save and retrieve data from disk. It would be responsible for managing the on-disk storage of incoming streams.
*   The playback component would use `filesrc`, decoding, encoding, and muxing elements to read data from disk, transcode it into the desired format, and send it to clients. It would support multiple communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, and RTMP.
*   The server program would also include code for handling client requests, such as starting and stopping streams, seeking within streams, and adjusting playback parameters.

**Possible file structure**:

*   `main.c`: Contains the main function that sets up the GStreamer pipeline and starts the main loop.
*   `network.c`: Contains code for the network component of the pipeline, including functions for receiving data from clients and sending it to the storage component.
*   `storage.c`: Contains code for the storage component of the pipeline, including functions for saving and retrieving data from disk.
*   `playback.c`: Contains code for the playback component of the pipeline, including functions for reading data from disk, transcoding it into the desired format, and sending it to clients.
*   `request_handler.c`: Contains code for handling client requests, such as starting and stopping streams, seeking within streams, and adjusting playback parameters.

**Further Description**

* This pseudo code shows how the different `.c` files interact with each other to receive, store, and playback data. The `main.c` file sets up the GStreamer pipeline and starts the main loop. The `network.c` file contains code for receiving data from clients and sending it to the storage component, as well as sending data to clients. The `storage.c` file contains code for saving and retrieving data from disk. The `playback.c` file contains code for reading data from disk, transcoding it into the desired format, and sending it to clients. Finally, the `request_handler.c` file contains code for handling client requests, such as starting and stopping streams, seeking within streams, and adjusting playback parameters.
